                Senghor and Léon Damas with whom he coined the concept of "négritude", promoting the African culture
                victim of the colonialism in the French Empire in Africa.</p>
            <p>He had several roles, especially high school teacher and as a left-wing intellectual, he also get
                involved in a political career. He was elected mayor of Fort-de-France (capital of Martinique, French
                West Indies) in 1945, then became deputy.</p>
            <blockquote>« Négritude is the simple recognition of the fact of being black, and the acceptance of this
                fact, of our destiny as black people, of our history and our culture. »</blockquote>
